  Description: Repackages existing JAR and WAR archives so that they can be
    executed from the command line using java -jar. With layout=NONE can also
    be used simply to package a JAR with nested dependencies (and no main
    class, so not executable).

[1mspring-boot:run[m
  Description: Run an executable archive application.

[1mspring-boot:start[m
  Description: Start a spring application. Contrary to the run goal, this
    does not block and allows other goal to operate on the application. This
    goal is typically used in integration test scenario where the application
    is started before a test suite and stopped after.

[1mspring-boot:stop[m
  Description: Stop a spring application that has been started by the 'start'
    goal. Typically invoked once a test suite has completed.
