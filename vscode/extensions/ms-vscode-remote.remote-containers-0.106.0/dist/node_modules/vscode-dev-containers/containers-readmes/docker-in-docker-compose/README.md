## Description

Dev containers can be useful for all types of applications including those that also deploy into a container based-environment. While you can directly build and run the application inside the dev container you create, you may also want to test it by deploying a built container image into your local Docker Desktop instance without affecting your dev container.

This example illustrates how you can do this by running CLI commands and using the [Docker VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) right from inside your dev container.  It installs the Docker extension inside the container so you can use its full feature set with your project.

## How it works / adapting your existing dev container config

You can adapt your own existing development container Docker Compose setup to support this scenario by following these steps:

1. First, install the Docker CLI in your dev container. From `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

    ```Dockerfile
    RUN apt-get update \
        #
        # Install Docker CE CLI
        && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common lsb-release \
        && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(lsb_release -is | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')/gpg | apt-key add - 2>/dev/null \
        && add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(lsb_release -is | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') $(lsb_release -cs) stable" \
        && apt-get update \
        && apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli \
        #
        # Install Docker Compose
        && curl -sSL "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose \
        && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

2. Then just forward the Docker socket by mounting it in the container in your Docker Compose config. From `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ```

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** so the changes take effect.

That's it!

## Using this definition with an existing folder

There are no special setup steps are required, but note that the included `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` can be altered to work with other Debian/Ubuntu-based container images such as `node` or `python`. Just, update the `FROM` statement to reference the new base image. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts
```

Beyond that, just follow these steps to use the definition:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Docker in Docker Compose definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/docker-in-docker-compose/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.
