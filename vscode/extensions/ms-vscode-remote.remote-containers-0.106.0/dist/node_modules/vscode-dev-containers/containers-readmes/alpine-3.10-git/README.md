## Using this definition with an existing folder

This definition does not require any special steps to use.

However, note that some extensions may not work in Alpine Linux due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension. You should also be aware that 3rd party tools, runtimes, and SDKs may not include a version that works on Alpine Linux for the same reason.

See [Remote Development and Linux](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/linux) for details.
